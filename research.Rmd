## Working Paper
##### Multi-Unit Ownership and Market Power: A Study of the Texas Hotel Industry [[Draft](Koh_JMP.pdf)]
- Abstract: As franchisees in the retail and service industries become experienced and acquire local market knowledge, they are likely to own multiple franchised units. Given non (or weak) exclusive clauses in franchising contracts or industry norms, some of these multi-unit owners are affiliated with multiple franchisors. Agency and transaction cost theories, the classic theoretical framework to analyze franchising, cannot explain this type of multi-franchisor affiliation since this type of ownership would create incentive problems across franchisors. Conversely, this paper investigates whether this type of the multi-unit ownership can be explained by the exercise of market power by these franchisees when their units are geographically clustered. This paper uses data on hotels near the interstate highway exits in Texas to test this hypothesis. The results of this paper show that multi-unit owners have contracts with more than one franchisor and that multi-unit owners charge higher prices than single-unit owners. Counterfactual analysis shows that without multi-unit ownership, prices would decrease by 3.91%, on average. This price increase is associated with a volume increase of 7.52%. These results help explain why franchisors might be willing to engage in franchising contracts with franchisees that operate units associated with different franchisors.


##### Multimarket Contact in the Hotel Industry [[Draft]](Koh_MMC.pdf)
+ Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of multimarket contact(MMC) on collusive pricing in the hotel industry where most firms face competitors over geographic markets, even in metropolitan areas. To capture relevant market competition, this paper uses empirical approaches to define markets: a distance metric approach (Pinkse et al., 2002) and a clustering algorithm (Ester et al., 1996). In addition, since most hotels are in vertical contracts, such as franchising, this paper takes into account the vertical control of upstream firms over downstream firms when estimating the effect of MMC on collusive behavior. In this paper, both the effect of vertical control and MMC are simultaneously estimated. The results show that hotels with high levels of multimarket contact tend to cooperate setting higher prices. Using the estimates of the structural model, counterfactual analysis is conducted: absent the extent of collusive behaviors via multimarket contact, prices would be lower by 1.5% to 2%, indicating consumer welfare would be better off the prohibition on collusion through MMC.
